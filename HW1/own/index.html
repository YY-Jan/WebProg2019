    There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small..</small>  <mark>the</mark> <del>list</del> <underline>goes</underline> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.</p>

You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said
    </p>

<blockquote>
  Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other<br>
  time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that<br>
    we seek.

<h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
A &lt; div  &gt;is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line and take up the full width available.<br>
And a &lt; span &gt; tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.
